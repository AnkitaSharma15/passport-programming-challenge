#INSTRUCTIONS & IMPLEMENTATION
-> The   tree   should   contain   a   group   of   nodes,   with   a main   (root)   node   that   can   have   any   number   of ‘factories’.

-> The factory   nodes   can   in   turn   generate   a   set amount   of   random   numbers   (up   to   15), represented   as   child   nodes   of   their   respective factories.

-> Factories   and   children   should   be   created through   some   means   of   user   input   (right   click, button   press,   etc)   specifying   the   number   of children   to   generate   (up   to   15)   and   the   ranges   of those   children.

-> Factories   should   have   an   adjustable   name assigned   to   them,   be   removable,   and   have   an adjustable   lower   and   upper   bound   for   the random   number   generation.

-> All   users   should   see   any   changes   made   to the   tree   immediately   across   browsers without   refreshing   or   polling. (used socket.io)

-> On generation of child nodes and in edit, if user updates either of range then all   of  factory’s   existing   child   nodes   should be   removed.
